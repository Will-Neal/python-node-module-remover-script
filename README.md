# python-node-module-remover-script
A simple script that deletes all of the node modules within the folder it's in.

## Description

Packages are fantastic but they take up tons of space. Further, they are incredibly easy to install. Often we find ourselves with boatloads of folders containing endless node_modules wasting hard-drive space. This is a simple Python script to solve that problem.

## Installation

Clone the repo and drag the nm_remove.py file to the root of the folder containing all of your projects with node_modules. Use `python nm_remove.py` to run the script. Simple as that. 

Honestly. the script is so short, you could easily just start a python file with the same or your desired name and copy and paste it from the nm_remove.py file to your file. Use the same command and say goodbye to those node_modules.

## Usage

This script is super simple to use.

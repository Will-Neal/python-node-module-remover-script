# python-node-module-remover-script
A simple script that deletes all of the node modules within the folder it's in.

## Description

Packages are fantastic but they take up tons of space. Further, they are incredibly easy to install. Often we find ourselves with boatloads of folders containing endless node_modules wasting hard-drive space. This is a simple Python script to solve that problem.

## Installation

Clone the repo and drag the nm_remove.py file to the root of the folder containing all of your projects with node_modules. Honestly. the script is so short, you could easily just start a python file with the same or your desired name and copy and paste it from the nm_remove.py file to your file. 

## Usage

This script is super simple to use. Use `python nm_remove.py` to run the script. Simple as that. Say goodbye to all of those node_modules.

MIT but who cares? Currently it's the os package firing off some basic commands you can find on stack overflow. Steal it, use it, modify it, I don't feel like there's enoug here to own it.

## Future Development

I would like to implement some user interaction to allow you to point it at a specific directory or file path and to give the user basic options like viewing the paths of the node_modules folders before deleting. Nothing crazy.
